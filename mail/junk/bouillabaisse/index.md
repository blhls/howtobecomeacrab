# Bouillabaisse à la crabe


**Ingredients (4–6)**  
- two crabs
- 1.5–2 kg of mixed fish (e.g. rascasse, red mullet, monkfish, conger)  
- 2 onions  
- 2 leeks 
- 8 garlic cloves  
- 3–4 tomatoes (or 1 tin)  
- 2 fennel bulbs, cut in four
- Olive oil  
- 1 orange with its skin, cut in half
- Bay leaf, thyme, saffron, nora hojilla (yes)
- Salt, pepper to taste
- 1–2 litres water or fish stock

**Method**  
1. Sweat onions/leeks/fennel in a very generous amount of olive oil until soft. Add garlic.  
2. Add tomatoes, herbs, orange, spices. Cook down 10 min.  
3. Add water/stock, bring to a simmer.  
4. If the crabs are raw, add now. If cooked, wait until you add the delicate fish.
5. Add firm fish first, then delicate fish later. Simmer gently (don’t boil hard).   
6. Serve with toasted bread and rouille.
